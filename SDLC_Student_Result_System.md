Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Project Title: Student Result Management System
1. Requirements Analysis
The Student Result Management System is designed to manage and process student academic results.
The system allows users to enter student details and scores, calculate total and average scores, and display the results.
Functional Requirements
The system shall allow input of student name
The system shall allow input of student scores
The system shall calculate total score
The system shall calculate average score
The system shall display student results
Non-Functional Requirements
The system shall be simple and easy to use
The system shall run on a command-line interface
The system shall be implemented using Python
2. System Design
The system is designed using a modular approach with Python functions.
Design Components
add_student() – collects student name and scores
calculate_average() – calculates total and average score
display_result() – displays the student result
The system flow is:
User Input → Processing → Output Display
3. Implementation
The system is implemented using the Python programming language.
Functions are used to ensure clarity, reusability, and easy maintenance.
All function names used in the design phase are maintained in the implementation phase.
4. Testing
The system was tested using different student names and scores.
Valid inputs were provided to confirm accurate calculations of total and average scores.
The system produced correct outputs during testing.
5. Deployment
The system is deployed by running the Python file using the Python interpreter.
Example command:
Copy code

python student_result.py
6. Maintenance
The system can be improved in the future by:
Adding support for multiple students
Saving results to a file or database
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI)
